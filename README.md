# IOS-Calculator-for-Windows.

Made by @misterofgames_yt in python. I used IOS calculator ui and remade everything in python. You cant get banned on my calculator btw. It's free you can use it how much you want, but you cant edit it without my permission. You need to give me credits if you use any of my work and projects.


Libraries requirement: pip install numpy Pillow pyinstaller

Python: Python 3.11 or Python 3.11.9
